# Labs for EE292D Edge ML

[EE292D Edge ML](https://ee292d.github.io/) is a ten week Stanford class 
focused on running machine learning on edge devices. We're using Raspberry Pi 5
boards as our standard platform, and we teach you how to run vision, audio, and
large language models locally, with no cloud connection (or charges). No prior 
knowledge of ML or programming is required.

We aim to make the lab assignments for this class as accessible as possible, so
we're open sourcing all the code and documentation. If you want to learn how to
run these models on a Pi yourself, here are links to the lab instructions:

 * [Lab 0: Set up your Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab0/README.md)
 * [Lab 1: Run a Large Language Model](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab1/README.md)
 * [Lab 2: Classify Images](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab2/README.md)
 * [Lab 3: Locate People and Objects](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab3/README.md)
 * [Lab 4: Understand Speech](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab4/README.md)
 * [Lab 5: Translate Languages](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab5/README.md)
 * [Lab 6: Train a Large Language Model](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/blob/main/lab6/README.md)

## Fork Me!

I recommend [forking this project on GitHub](https://github.com/ee292d/labs/fork)
as the first step, so you have your own copy of the code and can save any
changes you end up making.
